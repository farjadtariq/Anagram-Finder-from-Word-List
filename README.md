## Introduction
This Python program aims to identify and categorize anagrams from a list of words supplied by the user via a text file. Anagrams are words that have the same letters but in a different order. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate data manipulation and string sorting techniques in Python.

## Features
- Reads words from a user-defined text file.
- Sorts the letters in each word to make it easier to find anagrams.
- Groups the anagrams and displays them in a formatted table.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `python main.py`.
4. When prompted, input the name of the text file containing the words.

## Results
- Generates a table with the sorted letters of each word and the corresponding anagrams.
- Provides a termination message with the current date and time.

## Analysis
1. **Efficiency**: The algorithm employs basic Python data structures and string manipulation functions for an efficient yet straightforward approach.
2. **Usability**: The code has a user-friendly interface, with clear prompts for user input.
3. **Flexibility**: Works with any text file containing a list of words, offering a flexible solution for identifying anagrams.

## Significance
1. **Educational**: This project serves as an excellent learning experience for manipulating strings and lists in Python.
2. **Practical Use**: Can be used in applications that require word manipulation or sorting, such as word games or educational software.
3. **Skill Enhancement**: It's a good exercise for improving programming skills like file handling, string manipulation, and using Python lists.
